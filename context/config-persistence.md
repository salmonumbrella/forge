# Config Persistence Invariants

Use this document when adding or changing config fields that kenn-forge saves
back to TOML.

- `configFile` in `internal/config/config.go` is the hand-maintained subset of `Config` that `Save` writes to disk. A `Config` field absent from `configFile` (or from the `Save` initializer) loads from TOML fine but is silently dropped on the next save or restart.
- Every new persisted config field or section must be wired in three places — `Config`, `configFile`, and the `Save` initializer — and covered by a save/load round-trip test with a non-default value (see `TestPullRequestsConfigRoundTrip` in `internal/config/config_test.go`).
- Omitted `fleet.role` means `coordinator`; an explicit `node` role and its
  coordinator binding must survive whole-file saves together
  (`internal/config/config.go::Fleet.RoleOrDefault`, `internal/config/config.go::Config.Save`).
- `fleet.members` is coordinator-only active metadata keyed by stable node ID
  and canonical HTTPS origin. Enrollment does not change the startup-bound role;
  `fleet prepare-node` saves node role under the daemon's config mutation locks
  only after matching the durable seal; abort may reset an unactivated node
  (`internal/config/config.go::Fleet.Validate`,
  `internal/server/node_preparation.go::Server.persistPreparedNodeRole`,
  `internal/server/settings_routes.go::Server.resetPreparedNodeBinding`).
- Unsupported fleet fields fail config loading through the undecoded-key gate.
  Do not add migration parsing or derive node identity from removed display
  metadata; operators must remove unsupported fields and enroll nodes explicitly
  (`internal/config/config.go::rejectUnsupportedConfigKeys`).
- Enrollment records, opaque preparation seals, and federation bearers live in
  0600 atomic JSON stores under `data_dir`, not TOML; settings and CLI output
  must never expose bearers or seals
  (`internal/federation/enrollment_store.go::DefaultStorePath`,
  `internal/federationauth/store.go::DefaultStorePath`).
- A node's settings response composes coordinator-owned provider policy with
  node-owned execution policy. Each node settings write must target exactly one
  owner; mixed-owner requests fail before either side changes. Node-local writes
  fetch their coordinator projection before saving, so a failed response never
  hides a committed local mutation (`internal/server/settings_handlers.go::Server.updateSettings`,
  `internal/server/settings_handlers.go::Server.updateLocalSettings`).
- Fleet preference writes never accept role, coordinator, or member state;
  those fields change only through enrollment and preparation workflows
  (`internal/server/settings_routes.go::Server.updateFleetSettings`).
- `fleet setup` reloads under the shared config lifecycle lock and never moves
  `data_dir` or writes enrollment-owned node role/binding state
  (`internal/fleetsetup/setup.go::Runner.Apply`).
- `activity.use_workspace_activity_for_recency` is one global PR, Issue, and Activity opt-in. Its zero value is intentionally false; successful settings writes and file reloads publish the committed value to handler snapshots (`internal/server/server.go::pullConfigSnapshot`).
- `detail.initial_timeline_entry_limit` is a global PR/issue presentation preference.
  Omitted or zero values default to 50; explicit values must remain within 10-250
  in both config loading and settings writes (`internal/config/config.go::Detail`).
- When zero is meaningful, represent the saved value as optional so TOML `omitempty` cannot turn explicit zero into an unset default; the round-trip test must cover zero (`internal/config/config.go::Terminal`).
- Whole-file settings mutations must hold `configReloadMu` before `cfgMu` while applying and saving changes, or the watcher can restore a stale snapshot between writes (`internal/server/settings_handlers.go::updateSettings`).
- Partial settings request objects must use pointer fields and merge only fields that were present; reusing persisted value structs collapses omission into zero values (`internal/server/settings_handlers.go::mcpSettingsUpdate`).
- `roborev.init_managed_clones` is a hot-reloaded, false-by-default setup policy. It persists through the partial `roborev` settings object and the committed workspace API snapshot; only the effective Roborev endpoint remains in the startup-bound restart snapshot (`internal/config/config.go::Roborev`, `internal/server/config_reload.go::startupConfigSnapshot`, `internal/server/workspaceapi/config.go::ConfigSnapshot`).
- Repository preset config stores only named custom definitions; `Global` is a derived UI preset and must never be serialized to TOML. Each member persists provider, provider host, provider-verified repository ID, and a last-known display route; preset create/update/delete use dedicated atomic settings endpoints instead of replacing the collection through generic settings (`internal/config/config.go::RepoPreset`, `internal/server/settings_handlers.go::mutateRepoPresets`).
